# Python-Project
# Purpose: To graph the trend for covid cases in India
# This Project will display the spikes and positivity rate of Covid-19 in India by plotting the amount of positive cases for each specific day over a given period of time. This will be visualized using a line graph with the x axis being date and y axis being positive cases.

# Steps:
# 1- import pandas for data manipulation
# 2- import numpy for numerical computation
# 3- import matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, and plotly.express for plotting and visualiazations
# 4- use plotly.subplots to import make_subplots for plotting and visualiazations
# 5- use datetime for plotting specific dates/times
# 6- import the data using a link to the csv file by using df=pdf.read_csv
# 7- use df.head to display a number of rows of the data 
# 8- use df.describe to show the numerical analysis of the dataset
# 9- define data
# 10- define variables and assign them specific data values using data.iloc[number of rows, column # of variable in dataset] *data.iloc locates the variable that you are defining, within the dataset that was defined*
# 11- identify the variables being plotted
# 12- define the size of the figure
# 13- Plot the axis and set variations for the axis inlcuding length, color, and name
# 14- Plot the line for the graph and set variations such as width, color, and size
# 15- compile and run
